Step 0: There should be an inp-params.txt already present in the current directory with the values of number of points and number of threads written. Since it is not a part of deliverables, I didn't submit any such file. Make an inp-params.txt before running the program.

TAS IMPLEMENTATION:
Step 1: Compile the code using the following command
g++ -std=c++14 Assgn3-Src-TAS-CS21BTECH11022.cpp -pthread

Step 2: Execute the executable using the following command
./a.out

After the execution is done, a file named TAS_output.txt will be created, where the required data output will be reflected.

CAS IMPLEMENTATION:
Step 1: Compile the code using the following command
g++ -std=c++14 Assgn3-Src-CAS-CS21BTECH11022.cpp -pthread

Step 2: Execute the executable using the following command
./a.out

After the execution is done, a file named CAS_output.txt will be created, where the required data output will be reflected.

BOUNDED CAS IMPLEMENTATION
Step 1: Compile the code using the following command
g++ -std=c++14 Assgn3-Src-CAS-Bounded-CS21BTECH11022.cpp -pthread

Step 2: Execute the executable using the following command
./a.out

After the execution is done, a file named CAS_bounded_output.txt will be created, where the required data output will be reflected.
